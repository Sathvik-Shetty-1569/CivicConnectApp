## Introduction
In both urban and rural areas, unresolved civic issues (e.g., potholes, 
broken streetlights, inadequate waste management) negatively impact 
community safety, quality of life, and public trust in local governance. 
Current reporting systems often lack efficiency, transparency, and 
accessibility, hindering effective issue resolution. This communication 
gap between citizens and authorities impedes timely action and hinders 
community development.
